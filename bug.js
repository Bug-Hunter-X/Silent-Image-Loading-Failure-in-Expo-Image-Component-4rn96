This error occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that's either invalid or inaccessible.  The image might not exist at the specified URL, or there might be network issues preventing the component from loading it.  Expo's error handling in this scenario isn't always the clearest, sometimes just showing a blank space where the image should be.  Debugging requires checking the URI for correctness and network connectivity.
